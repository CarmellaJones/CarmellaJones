- 👋 Hi, I’m @CarmellaJones
- 👀 I’m interested in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, GraphQL, MySQL, React, and over time many more. 
  Coding in my newfound lifestyle. It makes it easy for me to get out of my own head and perform. My
  second hobby is blogging and writing in general. Between the 2 I am pretty busy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics again. Meaning, I am going back to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
I want to relay the groundwork now that I have configured a study plan, since I am more knowledgeable
about coding, in comparison to when I first started.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ANYONE that can assist me in a streaming app, but it is not like 
your average streaming app, so definitely contact me via email at: Jones.Carmella420@gmail.com to
collaborate with me in the nearby future.
- 📫 How to reach me Jones.Carmella420@gmail.com
